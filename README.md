# UsernameHistory
UsernameHistory is a Minecraft plugin which provides a command to view the entire username history of a player, going all the way back to their original name. 

Many servers enforce strict rules about name changes, because of the potential confusion they can cause. UsernameHistory aims to invalidate that issue. With this tool on your server, you can rest easy knowing you'll never have to wonder who you're talking to since they changed their name.

####How to use

The only command you need to know:

* /original \<username>

(\<username> being the *current* username)

The output is formatted nicely and includes the exact dates of each name change:
